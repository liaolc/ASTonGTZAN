#This holds most of the related results and files for the GTZAN music classification experiments. :grin:

Since files larger than 100MB cannot be uploaded to GitHub, the model checkpoints and some prediction csv outputs (contained in .zip files) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eZx7QmLVne8sjrIdfYOP-uja-g_pBVRf?usp=sharing)

Accuracy and other stats like validation accuracy can be seen by reading through the .txt log files. 

Hyperparameters are contained in .sh files with "final_run_GTZAN_template" being the basis of almost all experiments presented.
